Robotic arms are a common project idea for engineers, providing the opportunity to tackle challenges such as feedback loops, PCB designing, firmware programming, and mechanical designing. The difficulty varies greatly, from using basic Microservos driven by Arduino to using industry-standard MCUs like the STM32 family to achieve impressive torque, precision, accuracy, and speed. 
Our design will lean somewhat to the right (industry-like) side of difficulty, utilizing the STM32F103C8Tx model of MCU's for performance, TMC motor drivers, the motors will be  2 NEMA 23 (QSH6018) for shoulders, and NEMA 17 (QSH6018) for elbow. Stepper motors are chosen for their high torque relative to their low costs, possibly getting away with $30 for each NEMA 23, depending on the seller. Gearboxes will be utilized for each motor to increase torque output. We'll also lean into the gritty, brutalist aesthetic of industry, partially because I had minimal CAD experience at the beginning of this project.
The "quirk" of our project is that the robotic arm will be wearable. Current design ideas include straps similar to those of a hiking backpack, but will possible change in the future due to ergonomic reasons or if I just came up with better ideas. To control the robotic arm, a GUI will be made with sliders that control each joint, and activators for motor modes (Stealthchop2, spreadcycle). 

This project was made out of a desire to learn embedded systems, firmware code, and basic mechanical design. It is also partially motivated by having Viktor from Arcane as my favorite character.
